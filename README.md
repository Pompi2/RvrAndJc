## App is under currently development
### Current State
Currently, the application uses a [static JSON hosting](https://github.com/Hashik-Donthineni/TemporaryJSONHosting). Development work is underway in the back end at the college server to provide data in JSON format and for authentication.

### Development 
App uses MVVM architecture. Since the backend is under development as mentioned above, I am using a hard-coded authentication on the client-side to facilitate the client-side development until the backend authentication is ready. <br>

To login, use the following credentials...
```
